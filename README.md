# 404Checker
A very simple program that checks urls for error codes.

It's a little bit sloppy as I threw it together in about 20 minutes just to help a friend who needed to check a lot of URLs.

Usage
Run the exe and click the only button. Select a file that has all the URLs saved each on a line, the program will test them and print each result to a cmd window as it goes. Some links take a while. Do not assume the program has crashed. The results will be saved to TestedLinks.txt in the same directory as the orignal file.
